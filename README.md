# CPU Monitor

Simple, effective CPU monitor tool built on React, Chart.js, Node (via the OS module) and WebSockets.

## Features
- A real-time chart that displays the CPU load trend over the last 10 minutes
- Automatically alerts the user if high CPU load is detected (and when it recovers as well)
- Keeps track of all the previous alerts

## Getting started
1. *npm install* to install all dependencies
2. *npm start* to build the application and initiate the Express server (accessed via localhost:5000)

In addition, *npm run dev* executes a dev environment with hot loading available, and *npm test* starts the test script.
