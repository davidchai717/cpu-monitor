# CPU Monitor

Simple, effective CPU monitor tool for desktops built on React, Chart.js, Electron, and Node's internal modules.

## Features

- A real-time chart that displays the CPU load trend over the last 10 minutes
- Automatically alerts the user if high CPU load is detected (and when it recovers as well)
- Keeps track of all the previous alerts

## Getting started

1. _npm install_ to install all dependencies
2. _npm run build:ui_ to build the React UI
3. _npm start_ to build the application and start in a dev environment

In addition, _npm run dev_ enables a hot module reloading server for the UI.
